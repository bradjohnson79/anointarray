## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Servers won't start:**
```bash
# Check environment configuration
cat .env.mcp.local

# Verify dependencies
npm install

# Check port availability
lsof -i :3001-3008
```

**Build optimization not working:**
```bash
# Restart Serena build server
./mcp/scripts/restart-dev.sh serena

# Check build logs
tail -f mcp/logs/serena-dev.log
```

**Deployment issues:**
```bash
# Verify Vercel token
npm run mcp:health

# Check deployment logs
tail -f mcp/logs/vercel-dev.log
```
