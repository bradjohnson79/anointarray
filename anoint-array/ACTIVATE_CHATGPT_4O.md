## 🧪 Testing the Real ChatGPT 4o

Once configured, test with these phrases in the chatbot:

- **"I found a bug on the login page"** → Full self-healing workflow
- **"The site is running slow"** → Performance optimization
- **"What's the system status?"** → Health monitoring
- **"Help me with an error"** → Technical support

## 🔍 Verification

**Working correctly when you see:**
- Detailed, contextual responses (not generic fallbacks)
- Specific technical analysis
- References to "Claude Sonnet 3.7 fixer"
- Professional diagnostic language
- No "fallback: true" in API responses

**Still using fallbacks when you see:**
- Generic template responses
- "fallback: true" in network tab
- Randomized percentages/data

## 🛡️ Security Notes

✅ **API Key is secure** - stored server-side only  
✅ **No client exposure** - all calls through `/api/self-healing-ai`  
✅ **Authentication separate** - still uses mock system in `lib/auth.ts`  
✅ **Supabase limited** - only for OpenAI API, not auth  

## 🎯 Ready!

Once activated, your ANOINT Array will have the world's first fully autonomous self-healing AI system powered by ChatGPT 4o and Claude Sonnet 3.7! 

The chatbot will become incredibly intelligent and provide real-time system maintenance and support.
